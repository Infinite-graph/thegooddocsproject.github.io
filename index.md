_“Best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software.”_

### What?

Every project deserves a minimum level of _Good Docs_ that help users understand and solve problems with your product. But it can be really hard to know where to start or what to write. 

We are creating processes, templates, and guides covering the numerous aspects of writing good documentation. We describe our reasoning, referencing research where available, to help writers decide when they should deviate from suggestions.

### Why?

We want to help open source projects be more effective and more impactful by helping them lift the quality of their documentation. 

Our open-source Minimum Viable Docset (MVD) will help you create a baseline set of documentation using a suite of templates.

### Who?

We are writing for people who have an open source project and want to improve their docs.

Our target readers are software developers and early-stage technical writers, who can read and write English, and are motivated to learn by example.
