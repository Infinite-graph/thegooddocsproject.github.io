### Email lists
Email lists are our primary form of communication. How to join and archives are linked from:

* [Main list](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/main): Development discussion.
* [Announcements](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/announce): Announcements about releases and key events. (Typically monthly).
* Questions to our mentors about our [Season of Docs](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates/wiki/Season-of-Docs-Ideas-2020) involvement can be sent to [season-of-docs AT thegooddocsproject.groups.io](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/season-of-docs/).  

Why do we prefer email lists?

* They are archived.
* They work well for people working across multiple timezones and work patterns.

### Slack

We often chat in slack. You can join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/enQtODkyNjI5MDc0NjE0LTUyNGFiZmU1MjIzNDMwN2E3NmQwODQwZmRkYWI5MDhlMzdjYzg4Nzg4YjM3ODA0NGE4MTgyYzdkMGViMTI2MDM).

The main channels are:

* #announcements: Notifications of upcoming initiatives / releases / etc.
* #general: General development discussion
* #random: Non-work-related stuff

### Real-time conference calls

As of 2019/2020 we have been holding weekly half-hour video conference calls. The timeslot often changes. Reach out to us to get an invitation. All interested in contributing are welcome.

### Weekly meeting minutes

Minutes from our weekly meetings can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/wiki/Weekly-Meetings). 

### Code of conduct

We are nice to each other, in line with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md).

### Who are we?

We are a bunch of technical writers, educators, product developers and power users who also write. Some of us have big titles in large organisations; others donâ€™t. We are committed to helping others write great documentation through this project.

Our [who are we](who-we-are.html) page lists our active members who have taken up official roles.
