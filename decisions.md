# Decisions

This page describes the decision making processes used within The Good Docs Project.

**Version:** 2.0

**Last updated:** August 2020

## Voting

Decisions are based on voting using the following:

*   +1 : For
*   +0: Mildly for, but mostly indifferent
*   0: Indifferent
*   -0: Mildly against, but mostly indifferent
*   -1 : Strongly against. This is expected to be accompanied by a reason.

## Simple decisions

For most decisions, a motion is raised within one of The Good Docs Project open forums (slack, email list, weekly meeting, etc.) and those present vote and decide. 

## Significant decisions

Should a decision:

*   Be of interest to others not present,
*   Be strategic or impact many within the project,
*   Be contentious, and after discussion at least one member is still strongly against the motion, by continuing to vote -1,

then a motion should be raised as an email thread on our [general email list](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/main). The subject line should start: “Motion: …”

All community members are encouraged to vote to demonstrate community support, however contentious motions will only count votes from PSC members.

A motion is considered passed when there are more PSC +1 votes than -1 votes, and either all PSC members have voted, or 4 days have passed. In the case of a tie, the PSC chair shall have the deciding vote.

## Record decisions

*   All decisions should be captured in meeting minutes or forwarded to our email list. 
*   Results of significant decisions should be copied into our [decision register](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/governance/wiki/Decision-Log-2010).
