## The Good Docs Project Decisions

### Criteria for Decision Making

Decisions are based on voting using the following:

    +1 : For
    +0: Mildly for, but mostly indifferent
    0: Indifferent
    -0: Mildly against, but mostly indifferent
    -1 : Strongly against. This is expected to be accompanied by a reason.

For most decisions, a motion is raised within one of TheGoodDocsProject open forums (slack, email list, etc) and those present vote and decide. Should a decision:

    Be strategic or impact many within TheGoodDocsProject,
    Or if there is contention in deciding, and after discussion at least one member is still strongly against the motion, by continuing to vote -1,

Then the motion should be referred to the PSC.

For motions presented to the PSC, a motion is considered passed when there are more PSC +1 votes than -1 votes, and either all PSC members have voted, or 4 days have passed. In the case of a tie, the PSC chair shall have 1.5 votes.
